      Salutations, Fortnite Baby Virgin. My name? Oh, you can call me the Two
      Time. I know I'm probably a little too alpha to be seen talking to you,
      but whatever, the Two Time Champion makes his own rules. Why don't you
      take some time to get to know me better? Like DaBaby always says, me and
      him are buddies obviously, Lessgoo. Well, as you already know, I'm two
      time Blockbuster Video Game World Champion est. 1993. Of course, that's
      only the most prestigious gaming title of the 20th century.

      Oops, I almost forgot... I built this website in like 10 minutes or
      something with no help whatsoever. So, you could pack that web dev title
      right underneath Two Time trophies I polish every night.
